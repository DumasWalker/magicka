===== Managing Users =====

==== Resetting a user's Password ====

If a user forgets their password, it can be reset to something else.

    ./utils/reset_pass/reset_pass users.sq3 username newpass

==== Changing a user's Security Level ====

At present this must be done with an sqlite utility, for the sqlite3 command

    update users set sec_level=99 where loginname = "apam";

Please ensure there is a respective sXX.ini where XX is the security level
you are changing to.

To delete a user from the users.sq3 file, use the userdel utility.

    ./utils/userdel/userdel users.sq3 username
