===== File Area Setup =====

File directories and subdirectories are similar to message conferences and
areas to set up in that they have a main section followed by sections
describing each subdirectory.

## Example Config

    [main]
    Visible Sec Level = 10
    Visible On Web = false
    Visible Req Flags = someflag anotherflag
    Visible Not Flags = thirdflag

    [Area One]
    Database = area_one
    Download Sec Level = 10
    Upload Sec Level = 99
    Upload Path = /path/to/MagickaBBS/files/area_one
    Download Req Flags = someflag
    Download Not Flags = anotherflag
    Upload Req Flags = thirdflag
    Upload Not Flags = someflag

    [Area Two]
    Database = area_two
    Download Sec Level = 10
    Upload Sec Level = 99
    Upload Path = /path/to/MagickaBBS/files/area_two

In the main section variables apply to the whole directory, 

  * Visible Sec Level
  
  This is the security level required to view the directory.

  * Visible On Web

  This is either true, false or authenticated if you want it visible and the
  files downloadable via the website.

  * Visible Req Flags

  Required flags (seperated by space) that a user needs to see this file
  directory. (Not required)

  * Visible Not Flags

  Required flags a user must not have to see this file directory. (Not 
  Required)

The section name for the sub-directory is the name of the sub directory.

  * Database
  
  is the name of the database that stores the information of the files, it is
  stored in the main BBS directory. No extension is required.

  * Download Sec Level
  
  This is the security level required to download files from the subdirectory.

  * Upload Sec Level
  
  This is the security level required to upload files to the subdirectory.

  * Upload Path
  
  This is the directory in which uploads are stored for the subdirectory, make
  sure it's writable for the BBS.

  * Upload Req Flags

  Flags required by a user to be able to upload in this directory. (Not 
  Required)

  * Upload Not Flags

  Flags a user is required not to have to be able to upload in this directory.
  (Not Required)

  * Download Req Flags

  Flags required by a user to be able to download from this directory. (Not 
  Required)

  * Download Not Flags

  Flags a user is required not to have to be able to download in this 
  directory. (Not Required)

==== Uploading Files ====

When a user (or the sysop) uploads a file, they are not *approved* by default,
so they will not be shown in the listings. To approve uploaded files, the
sysop should run the filecenter utility on the database.

    cd utils/filecenter
    ./filecenter -c ../../config/bbs.ini

This will list all the files in the database, and allow the sysop to toggle
the approved status, or remove the file entirely.

==== Mass Uploading ====

If you have a directory full of files you want to upload, you can use the
massupload perl script. This script will upload and approve all files in a
folder, and if they are ZIP files check for file_id.diz files and import them
into the description.

    ./utils/massupload/massupload.pl /path/to/MagickaBBS/files/area_one area_one.sq3

Note that you must use the FULL path of the directory the files are in.
