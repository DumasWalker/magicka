===== Remote Settings for QWK nodes =====

Usually QWK based networks are run by Synchronet BBS systems, and when signing
up will ask you if you are a Synchronet Sysop. You should answer no, this will
set your settings to the most basic, which need some tweaking.

You should enable HEADERS.TXT if available, you can also expand Ctrl-A codes
to ANSI if you want coloured messages.

All other settings should be left as-is.
