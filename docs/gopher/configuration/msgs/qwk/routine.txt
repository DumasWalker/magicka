===== Suggested Routine =====

It is suggested to create a script to run qwkscan, do a transfer and run
qwktoss in succession.

This script can then be called by cron at an interval suggested by the network
coodinator.

eg.

#!/bin/bash

cd /home/andrew/MagickaBBS/qwk
../utils/qwknet/qwkscan qwk.ini
python3 ../utils/qwknet/qwknetftpc.py qwk.ini
../utils/qwknet/qwktoss qwk.ini
