===== Configuring MNet Message Bases =====

MNet (MagiNet) Message base configuration is similar to Local bases, except
they include an extra network section, and networked = true in the main
section.

Here is an example included in the default install.

    [main]
    Visible Sec Level = 10
    Networked = true
    Real Names = false

    [network]
    type = magi
    magi node = 3
    domain = happynxt

    [General]
    Read Sec Level = 10
    Write Sec Level = 10
    Path = /home/andrew/MagickaBBS/msgs/hnn_gen
    Type = Echo 
    QWK Name = HN_GEN
    QWK Conference = 201

The network block contains the following:

**Type**

This equals magi for maginet style networks.

**Magi Node**

This is your maginet node number

**Domain**

This is the domain of the maginet network, not currently used with maginet

**Tagline**

This is optional and can be used to set network specific taglines.

The area sections are identical to local mail, with the exception that Type
should equal "Echo". "Netmail" areas are not supported in maginet.

This is all for setting up maginet networked bases in magicka, however you
will still need to configure the scanner/tosser and ftp client.
